# NoteTrainer
Web application that trains users to play different chords, by recognizing correct tone.

This is a work in proces, and the purpose is two-fold. Both to help me learn guitar, and to demonstrate my proficiency in React. My goal is to have it continuously recognizing notes, indicating when correct and incorrect notes are played, and generating new chords to play. This will help with arpeggios, which is when you play the three notes in a chord sequentially instead of all at once.

Thanks for taking a look!
